# gcode2temptower

## Intro
Turn any gcode file into a termperature tower. Just slice your file as normal with CURA and then pass it through gcode2temptower.py. 

## Features
- Reads any gcode file sliced with CURA and add M104 and M109 temperature lines to it so that it turns the gcode file into a temperature tower.

## Status
gcode2temptower is still considered: testing. First results have been proven reliable but I would still consider this beta due to its limited testing scenarioâ€™s. It has succesfully been tested with Linux, FreeBSD and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

## Configuration
gcode2temptower.py uses four commandline parameters,
| Parameter      | Description                                                                                     |
| :------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| start layer    | The first layer to start changing the temperatures from; could also be considered "skip layers" |
| layer step     | After the first layer skip # number of layers before decreasing the temperature                 |
| start temp     | Starting temperature in celcius                                                                 |
| temp decrement | Decrease the temperature by # degrees celcius for the next layer                                |

### Example use
```
cat SmartTemperatureTower_PLA_180-225.gcode | ./gcode2temptower.py 57 50 225 5 > SmartTemperatureTower_PLA_180-225-result.gcode
```

## TODO:
- Make a non "cat" version
